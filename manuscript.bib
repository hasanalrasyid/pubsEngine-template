        abstract = {We have derived and implemented a stress tensor formulation for the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) with spin-polarization-dependent gradient c
orrection (GC) recently proposed by the authors [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 82, 093701 (2013)] and applied it to nonmagnetic and magnetic molecular crystals under ambient condition.
 We found that the cell parameters of the molecular crystals obtained with vdW-DF show an overall improvement compared with those obtained using local density and generalize
d gradient approximations. In particular, the original vdW-DF with GC gives the equilibrium structural parameters of solid oxygen in the Î±-phase, which are in good agreement
 with the experiment.},
