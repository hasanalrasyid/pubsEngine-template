# IAU recommendations for nominal units

The IAU 2015 resolution B3 defines nominal solar and planetary values by
establishing conversions between solar and planetary values and SI units.
The rational and specifications are given in \citet{2016AJ....152...41P}.
The recommended nominal conversion constants for \latex have been
incorporate into v6.31 to help authors follow the IAU resolution.

The general commands take this form:

AASTeX v6.31 also contains specific commands for other commonly used
units. These are:

All of these commands work equally well in text and math mode.

# Using Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters

Authors have the option to include names in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (CJK)
characters in addition to the English name. The names will be displayed
in parentheses after the English name. The way to do this in AASTeX is to
use the CJK package available at \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/cjk?lang=en}.
