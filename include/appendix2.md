# Author publication charges

Finally some information about the AAS Journal's publication charges.
In April 2011 the traditional way of calculating author charges based on
the number of printed pages was changed.  The reason for the change
was due to a recognition of the growing number of article items that could not
be represented in print. Now author charges are determined by a number of
digital ``quanta``.  A single quantum is 350 words, one figure, one table,
and one enhanced digital item.  For the latter this includes machine readable
tables, figure sets, animations, and interactive figures.  The current cost
for the different quanta types is available at
\url{https://journals.aas.org/article-charges-and-copyright/#author_publication_charges}.
Authors may use the ApJL length calculator to get a *rough* estimate of
the number of word and float quanta in their manuscript. The calculator
is located at \url{https://authortools.aas.org/ApJL/betacountwords.html}.
