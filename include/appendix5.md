# Using Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters

Authors have the option to include names in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (CJK)
characters in addition to the English name. The names will be displayed
in parentheses after the English name. The way to do this in AASTeX is to
use the CJK package available at \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/cjk?lang=en}.
Further details on how to implement this and solutions for common problems,
