# Appendix information

Appendices can be broken into separate sections just like in the main text.
The only difference is that each appendix section is indexed by a letter
(A, B, C, etc.) instead of a number.  Likewise numbered equations have
the section letter appended.  Here is an equation as an example.
\begin{equation}
I = \frac{1}{1 + d_{1}^{P (1 + d_{2} )}}
\end{equation}
Appendix tables and figures should not be numbered like equations. Instead
they should continue the sequence from the main article body.
