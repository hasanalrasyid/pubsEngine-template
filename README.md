# pubsEngine-template

This repository is a Proof of Works (POW) for [`pubsEngine`](https://github.com/hasanalrasyid/pubsengine).
It also stands as a scaffolding for a manuscript project.

# Usage

Just `make` it.

By default, `make` will produce `_build/manuscript.pdf`.
This document will be built under `article` template.

To make your own project, just edit `manuscript.md`.
All other files will be following this main document.
All results will be collected inside `_build/`.

All issues should be addressed to the main project issues tracker at [pubsEngine](https://github.com/hasanalrasyid/pubsengine/issues).
